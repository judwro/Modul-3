## Description

That is my second webside which I create during cursus with YouCode school. Page about me. 
I use HTML, Css for styling class, some Java script and BEM convention. 
Here you can see tables with my favorite books that I have created.
Subsequently, you can see an unordered list of places that I recommend to visit.
At the very end there is a short gallery from my private collection.
